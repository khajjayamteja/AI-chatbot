This webiste will provide the symptoms and cure for the diseases by asking or typing the questions .

I have used the html and css for the website development
I have used the fuzzyset.js and sparc for writing the logic.

Flow of the project:
The first step of the project involves the user asking a question using either text or voice command. Once the question has been asked, the query is analyzed and broken down into its individual components. The objects in the query are then compared against the minimum accuracy level of knowledge mentioned in the code.
When the user clicks the submit button, the fuzzyset.js code is executed. The fuzzyset.js code uses fuzzy string matching to determine the most appropriate knowledge to match the user's query. The matched minimum accuracy level is then compared against the knowledge mentioned in the code.
Once the matched minimum accuracy level has been found, the corresponding result is returned. The response is displayed on the website UI, providing the user with the information they requested. The response is displayed in a user-friendly manner, making it easy for the user to read and understand the information provided.
Overall, this project aims to provide users with a convenient and easy-to-use platform to ask questions and receive accurate answers. The use of fuzzyset.js code allows the project to provide users with the most appropriate knowledge, even if the user's question is not an exact match for the knowledge in the program. By providing accurate and helpful information, the project helps users to save time and effort while finding answers to their queries.
